3: # [Required]. A connection profile contains information about a set of network
4: # components. It is typically used to configure gateway, allowing applications
5: # interact with a network channel without worrying about the underlying
6: # topology. A connection profile is normally created by an administrator who
7: # understands this topology.

10: #
11: # [Optional]. Analogous to HTTP, properties with an "x-" prefix are deemed
12: # "application-specific", and ignored by the gateway. For example, property
